kernel limitations

NNGP experiment on CIFAR

kernel methods on larger datasets

data samples needed damian work with polynomials

Question: Is there any work that says if a neural network is an universal approximator so is it's NNGP and NTK? I think [this says](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06956) it for NTK, at least for ReLU networks. [This](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04374) might also be related.

The thing about these kernel models is they can't build up hierarchical features like neural networks do. This matters
