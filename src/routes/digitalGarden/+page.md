Welcome to my [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/)! It is a garden of knowledge, that will hopefully grow large and strong as I become a better scientist. Pages here are more like notes and references (think [Zettelkasten](https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/slip-box/)) than put together [blog posts](/blog), [projects](/projects), or [publications](/publications). You may have to click around a bit to find the page you are interested in.
